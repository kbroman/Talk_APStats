## Talk on &ldquo;Genetics of extreme body size evolution in mice from Gough Island&rdquo;

These are slides for a talk that I gave to AP statistics students at
[Madison East High School](https://east.madison.k12.wi.us/) on 9 March
2017. (They are revised from a talk I gave at the
[Complex Trait Community 13th annual meeting](http://www.ctc2014.org) in
Berlin, Germany, on 21 May 2014.)

Slides and interactive graphs online at [bit.ly/APStats2017](http://bit.ly/APStats2017).
